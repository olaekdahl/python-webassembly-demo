# Python, Pyodide, and WebAssembly Demo

`python -m http.server` to run.

1. Python to WebAssembly Compilation:
    * Pyodide is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine, designed as a portable compilation target for high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.
2. Integration with JavaScript:
    * Once compiled to WebAssembly, Pyodide makes it possible to run Python code in the browser. This integration is seamless, allowing Python and JavaScript to communicate directly. Python objects can be converted to JavaScript objects and vice versa. For instance, a Python dictionary can be used as a JavaScript object, and Python functions can be called from JavaScript.
3. Standard Library and External Packages:
    * Pyodide includes the full standard library of Python and even supports third-party packages. Many packages that work with C extensions, like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, are available because WebAssembly allows these computationally intensive tasks to be performed in the browser. Pyodide uses a package management system similar to Pythonâ€™s pip, allowing users to install additional Python packages at runtime.
4. Filesystem and Networking:
    * Though running in a browser sandbox, Pyodide provides a virtual, in-memory, filesystem. This allows Python scripts to perform file operations. However, actual input/output operations are restricted to what's permissible within the browser's security model. Networking is possible through interfaces provided by the browser, or via the Fetch API, allowing Python scripts to make HTTP requests.
5. Use of Emscripten and WASI:
    * Pyodide is built using Emscripten, a toolchain that compiles C/C++ code into WebAssembly. It helps provide a POSIX-like environment for the code, making it easier to compile projects like Python which expect a traditional UNIX-like system. WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is also part of the broader ecosystem which Pyodide can utilize to interact with system resources in a standardized way.
6. Execution Environment:
    * The Python code executed within Pyodide runs in a web browser's main thread or a Web Worker. This code execution is sandboxed within the browser's security architecture, ensuring that Python code cannot perform any operations that JavaScript cannot.
